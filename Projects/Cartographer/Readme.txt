Cartographer is an application built to keep track of assets physically by location.

Map your wireless adapters, fire extinguishers, AED devices, HVAC equipment, fuse/breaker panels,
  security cameras, junction boxes, water lines, wired internet, power runs, badge readers, etc.

Cartographer is google maps for your assets in your spaces, defined and controlled in your style.
Where are the network closets, where are the building fuse boxes, where are the fire alarms?
All these can be tracked and documented in Cartographer.

Starting out:
1: Setup a cartographer account
2: Define your business
3: Select a location from a pre-built map, or upload standalone maps of your own
4: Select from a large library of pre-defined devices to track and begin placing your assets
  OR
4: Define your own custom assets with unique definitions and connections, and place your assets

5: Classify assets into layers for organization and clarity
6: Define roles to allow access to specific asset types, layers, buildings, sites, and more.
    Security of your assets is defined by whatever means fits your business model best.

Standard workflow:
User logs into cartographer web application (self-hosted)
User is prompted with list of sites to select from
Site selection takes your to map and list of viewable asset types / layers
Selection of all,many,or one item overlays item icons on maps
Selection of an individual item will produce a pop-up with detailed information on specific asset and a list
  of linked assets if available for viewing. Options to edit, move, or delete an object are also available based
  upon end user security level.
Selection of multiple assets is only possible on a single layer, and single asset type. Selecting multiple Assets
of similar type will display a general item description and count
